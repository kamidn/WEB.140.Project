			<h1>About us</h1>
			<article>
				<img src="./images/aboutus.jpg" alt="About us">
				<p>
					Vicious Cycles Inc is a Raleigh-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010.
					Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day to day operations.
					We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism.
					We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
				</p>
				<p>
					You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again.
					It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.

			<h2>Customer Service and Satisfaction</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing superior customer service and satisfaction.
					Our staff will assist you every step of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds.
					We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, and we've seen some ups and downs, we're loving every moment of it.
					A proper custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right.
					From stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all.
					Talk with a member of our mechanics team to discuss your plan, and we'll see your dream realized.

			<h2>Trade Shows</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom,
					but we believe the real showroom can only be found out on and off the road.
					Cycling is a lifestyle - Live Your Life.
